== Authentication

[quote, https://crypto.stackexchange.com/tags/authentication/info]
____
Authentication is successfully validating that an entity you are communicating
with is actually who they claim to be.
____

[NOTE.speaker]
====
This talk is about authorization and not authentication.
====

== Authorization

[quote]
____
Authorization is according or denying permission to a -- usually authenticated -- user.
____


[NOTE.speaker]
====
This talk is about authorization and not authentication.

=== Authorization schemes

- ACL linked directly to the user
- Anonymous bearer tokens

=== Bearer tokens

[quote]
____
A bearer token is a representation of a set of permissions.
____

=== Example permissions

- Viewing a specific file
- View and edit a specific file
- Anything a certain user can do

== Macaroons

- Google research paper published in 2014 <<pub41892>>

- Bearer token with a _signature_
- Decentralized _attenuation_ and _contextual confinment_ with _caveats_

== Anatomy of a macaroon

[frame=none, grid=none]
|===

|*Secret* | Nonce | Secret Key

|*Identifier* | Text/UUID | link to the secret

|*Location* | URL | Location indication of the emitter

|*Signature* 2+| stem:[HMAC(secret,identifier)]
|===

=== Code

[source, javascript]
.simple.js
----
include::simple.js[tags=frontmatter;simple]
----

=== Result

[source, console]
----
$ node simple.js
m: Simple macaroon
location mayoi
identifier it's a me, Mario
signature 7339954339bb20b9ceeb0cd4fff91f66ddbe6cc824efa49f165cbd950bc1dc1f
----

== Caveats

____
*Ordered* list of _predicates_ which restrict the macaroon's authority
____

Two types of caveats:

- _first party_ caveats, which directly restrict the macaroon's authority, and
- _third party_ caveats, which require additional evidence.

== First party caveats

Simple assertions

====
- `account = 123456`
- `file in ["accounts.pdf","bills.pdf"]`
- `time < 2017-05-18T14:45+02:00`
====

=== Structure

`cid: String`::
Caveat id (the predicate)


== Computing the signature

The signature is computed by chaining the HMAC operations.

[.step]
. stem:[sig_m = HMAC(secret, identifier)]
. stem:[sig_{m_2} = HMAC(sig_m, c)]
. stem:[sig_{m_3} = HMAC(sig_{m_2}, c_2)]

=== Code

[source, javascript]
.simple.js
----
include::simple.js[tag=caveats]
----

=== Result

[source, console]
----
$ node simple.js
location mayoi
identifier it's a me, Mario
signature 7339954339bb20b9ceeb0cd4fff91f66ddbe6cc824efa49f165cbd950bc1dc1f

m2: With a caveat c = 'talk = macaroons-hands-on'
location mayoi
identifier it's a me, Mario
cid talk = macaroons-hands-on
signature c247c5613203141be46a14008678a2aaec41d83c9cf69d7b10b5c4e533047abb

m3: With a caveat c2 = 'time < 2017-05-18T14:45+02:00'
location mayoi
identifier it's a me, Mario
cid talk = macaroons-hands-on
cid time < 2017-05-18T14:45+02:00
signature 4bd18fd10c0193ae25fc73ce3f89b46a64ffb6508025ba3faeb5acf2656a99f6
----

== Third party caveats

- External predicates not listed in the macaroon
- The predicate is sent to the third party, and an identifier is given back.

====
- The user must be logged to `auth.com` as _Alice_
- The user must have a valid session on our service as _Bob_
====


=== Structure

`key: String`::
Predicate to be satisfied by the third party
`cid: String`::
Caveat Id (the third party identifier)
`cl: Url`::
Url of the third party
`vid: String`::
stem:[enc(sig, key)]


== Verifying macaroons

[.step]
- Signature
- First party caveats
- Third party caveats



== Verifying first party caveats

[.step]
. Just check the predicate, parse it and verify it
. ???
. Profit !

== Verifying third party caveats

Third party macaroons must be _discharged_ by another macaroon, which must verify

[.step]
- The root secret of the discharging macaroon must match the one used
  to mint the caveat
- The verifier id must match
- The discharging caveat must be bound to the discharged caveat
